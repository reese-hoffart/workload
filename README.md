# Workload

Workload is an educational program that aims to empower teachers to help the well-being and stress of students by balancing their workload (get it :D). Workload uses a central database of assignment due dates that teachers througghout a school have set, and uses this data to determine the optimal times that teachers should schedule assignments to be due in order to avoid large amounts of due dates on one day.
