# Workload

Workload is an educational program that aims to empower teachers to help the well-being and stress of students by balancing their workload (get it :D). Workload uses a central database of assignment due dates that teachers througghout a school have set, and uses this data to determine the optimal times that teachers should schedule assignments to be due in order to avoid large amounts of due dates on one day.

## Inspiration
We are both high school students who take a large number of advanced classes. As such, we have experienced huge workloads that can often fall on one day, leading to lots of potential stress. We are excited to introduce an innovative approach to solve this problem for tons of students.

## What it does
Workload, our web application, maintains a database of assignment deadlines and test dates that teachers have set. Other teachers can see this master schedule as well as Workload's recommendations for when to schedule exams/dues dates to best balance out students' lives.

## How we built it
We built Workload using a ReactJS frontend served by a Python and MySQL backend. Our services all run on AWS.

## Challenges we ran into
We had many issues associated with debugging, as this was our first time using ReactJS and MySQL at this scale. However, we overcame all of the issues and managed to learn a lot throughout the process.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We're proud that we kept up morale over 36 hours of straight hacking on no sleep in the coldest place on the planet. We also developed a pretty sweet app, which has real-world potential.

## What we learned
While we learned a lot about new technologies such as React and SQL, we also developed a much deeper appreciation for sticking with a project even through big issues.

## What's next for Workload
We would like to continue adding features to Workload and fixing issues it has in order to see if it has the possibility of succeeding on a professional level through schools adopting it.
